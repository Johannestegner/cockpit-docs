Regions are editable content and code snippets which you can re-use everywhere on your website.


## Region Fields

![Edit Region Fields](create_fields.png)

Manage region fields in the field-manager and re-use them in the region template code.

## Region Template

![Edit Template](create_template.png)

Define a template code. You've access to every region field defined in the region field-manager.
Every template will be parsed on the server and the result will be returned as a string value.

You can also write PHP code for e.g. looping over field values.


## Region Entry Form

![Entry Form](form.png)

Content editors will get an easy to use form to manage the region data.
