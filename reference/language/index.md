If you want to add multiple Languages to your Backend you can simply copy the i18n Language File [from this Repository](https://github.com/COCOPi/cockpit-i18n) to `/config/i18n`

When the config or i18n folder is missing, just create 'em. Keep in mind to keep Webserver Permissions for those folders.
